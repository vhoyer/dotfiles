# Vim Free Keys

This is a list for underused or non-mapped keys in vim on normal mode (for you use with `nmap` or `nnoremap`):

- Q (switch to "Ex" mode) (personally I remap this to `<nop>`)
- Z (except ZZ and ZQ)
- \
- `<Space>` (same as `l` in the normal mode)
- gb, gc, gl, gx, gy, gz
- gs (put vim to sleep for `<Movement>gs` seconds, really, why?)
- zp, zq, zu, zy
- cd, cm, co, cp, cq, cr, cs, cu, cx, cy
- dc, dm, do, dp, dq, dr, ds, du, dx, dy
- gA, gB, gC, gG, gK, gL, gM, gO, gS, gX, gY, gZ
- zB, zI, zJ, zK, zP, zQ, zS, zT, zU, zV, zY, zZ
- ]a, ]b, ]e, ]g, ]h, ]j, ]k, ]l, ]n, ]o, ]q, ]r, ]t, ]u, ]v, ]w, ]x, ]y
- [a, [b, [e, [g, [h, [j, [k, [l, [n, [o, [q, [r, [t, [u, [v, [w, [x, [y
- CTRL-G, CTRL-K
- CTRL-\ a-z (reserved for extensions) (tho I never saw any extension using them)
- CTRL-\ A-Z (not used)
